            My journey began with a fascination for the web and its potential to
            connect people worldwide. I started exploring HTML and CSS during my
            early college years, and that curiosity soon grew into a
            full-fledged career. Over time, I honed my skills in JavaScript,
            React, and responsive design, turning complex ideas into
            interactive, visually appealing applications.

            What sets me apart is my ability to combine technical expertise with
            creative design, ensuring every project is both functional and
            delightful to use. Whether it's crafting pixel-perfect layouts or
            optimizing for performance, I bring a problem-solving mindset and a
            commitment to excellence to every task.
